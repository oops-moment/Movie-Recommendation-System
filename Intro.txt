There are two main types of recommender systems: content-based and collaborative-based.

In a content-based system, recommendations are made based on the content's attributes. For example, if you're listening to romantic songs, the system recommends more romantic songs based on tags.

Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, involves finding similarities between users. If User A and User B have similar preferences, when User A likes Movie M2, the system recommends Movie M2 to User B.

Hybrid systems combine both content and collaborative filtering methods.
